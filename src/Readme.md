This branch contains the default setup (old chamber) for the DAMIC experiment. It includes-
1) Bonner sphere
2) Californium source
3) Lead shielding
4) Steel cart
5) Poly table with wood
6) Vacuum steel chamber
7) All steel flanges
8) D4201 CCD 
9) Copper plate

The neutrons are modelled as Watt spectrum to simulate the decay of Californium. All particles which enter the CCD are recorded 
into a file under the tree "tree1".
